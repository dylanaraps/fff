# fff (*Fucking Fine File-Manager*)

### This fork is meant to make fff a more feature-rich file manager, but at cost of raw speed.

## Installation

### Manual

1. Download `fff`.
    - Git: `git clone https://github.com/piotr-marendowski/fff`
2. Change working directory to `fff`.
    - `cd fff`
3. Run `make install` inside the script directory to install the script.
    - **NOTE**: You may have to run this as root.

**NOTE:** `fff` can be uninstalled easily using `make uninstall`. This removes all of files from your system.

### CD on Exit
#### Bash and Zsh
```sh
# Add this to your .bashrc, .zshrc or equivalent.
# Run 'fff' with 'f' or whatever you decide to name the function.
f() {
    fff "$@"
    cd "$(cat "${XDG_CACHE_HOME:=${HOME}/.cache}/fff/.fff_d")"
}
```

## Usage

```sh
j: scroll down
k: scroll up
h: go to parent dir
l: go to child dir

enter: go to child dir/open file
backspace: go to parent dir

```

## Customization

`FFF_CONFIG` can be added to your `bashrc` (or other shell's configuration files). Everything put in `FFF_CONFIG` file will be sourced globally meaning that e.g. Neovim's terminal will have these settings.

Personal note (can be unreproducible for your): I'm not sure why the only option (maybe there are others) not working in config file is `FFF_HIDDEN` which only works, when fff is run inside terminal manually.

```sh
# Show/Hide hidden files on open.
# (Off by default)
export FFF_HIDDEN=1

# Show/Hide file icons on open
# (Off by default)
export FFF_FILE_ICON=1

# Show/Hide git status signs (+) on open

# In terminals that support truecolor, this will set the selection color

## Customizing the keybindings.

### Keybindings

This is the list of full keybindings along with their default values. You only need to modify the keybindings that you'd like to change from the default. `fff` will run perfectly fine without any of these defined.

```sh
### Moving around.

# Go to child directory.
export FFF_KEY_CHILD1="l"
export FFF_KEY_CHILD2=$'\e[C' # Right Arrow
export FFF_KEY_CHILD3=""      # Enter / Return

# Go to parent directory.
export FFF_KEY_PARENT1="h"
export FFF_KEY_PARENT2=$'\e[D' # Left Arrow
export FFF_KEY_PARENT3=$'\177' # Backspace
export FFF_KEY_PARENT4=$'\b'   # Backspace (Older terminals)

# Go to previous directory.
export FFF_KEY_PREVIOUS="-"

# Search.
export FFF_KEY_SEARCH="/"

# Spawn a shell.
export FFF_KEY_SHELL="!"

# Scroll down.
export FFF_KEY_SCROLL_DOWN1="j"
export FFF_KEY_SCROLL_DOWN2=$'\e[B' # Down Arrow

# Scroll up.
export FFF_KEY_SCROLL_UP1="k"
export FFF_KEY_SCROLL_UP2=$'\e[A'   # Up Arrow

# Go to top and bottom.
export FFF_KEY_TO_TOP="g"
export FFF_KEY_TO_BOTTOM="G"

# Go to dirs.
export FFF_KEY_GO_DIR=":"
export FFF_KEY_GO_HOME="~"
export FFF_KEY_GO_TRASH="t"
export FFF_KEY_REFRESH="z"

### File operations.
export FFF_KEY_MARK=" "
export FFF_KEY_MARK_ALL="a"
export FFF_KEY_COPY="c"
export FFF_KEY_MOVE="m"
export FFF_KEY_TRASH="d"
export FFF_KEY_LINK="s"
export FFF_KEY_BULK_RENAME="b"

export FFF_KEY_EXECUTE="p"

export FFF_KEY_RENAME="r"
export FFF_KEY_MKDIR="n"
export FFF_KEY_MKFILE="f"

### Miscellaneous

# Display file details.
export FFF_KEY_DETAILS="i"

# Display an image using sixel.
export FFF_KEY_SIXEL="I"

# Sort files.
export FFF_KEY_SORT="u"

# Show file attributes.
export FFF_KEY_ATTRIBUTES="x"

# Toggle executable flag.
export FFF_KEY_EXECUTABLE="X"

# Toggle hidden files.
export FFF_KEY_HIDDEN="."

# Show history of directories. 
export FFF_KEY_HISTORY="e"

# Yank filename to clipboard.
export FFF_KEY_CLIPBOARD="y"
```

### Disabling keybindings.

You can't unset keybindings by making their value `''`. What you need to do is change their value to `off`.

Example:

```sh
# KEY_GO_TRASH was bound to 't', now its unset.
export FFF_KEY_GO_TRASH="off"

# KEY_MKFILE is now set to 't' and its original
# keybinding is also unset 'f'.
export FFF_KEY_MKFILE="t"
```

### Dealing with conflicting keybindings.

When rebinding a key in `fff` make sure you don't have two bindings with the same value. You can avoid this by setting the other conflicting key-binding to something else or by changing its value to `off`.


### How to figure out special keys.

Below is a tiny script I've written which will tell you the exact value to use. It automates the deciphering of special key escape sequences to the exact value `fff` needs. Save this to a file and run it. Give it a key-press and it'll spit out the exact value needed.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Output the key-binding values for 'fff'.
key() {
    case "$1" in
        # Backspace.
        $'\b'|$'\177')
            printf '%s\n' "key: \$'\\b' or \$'\\177'"
        ;;

        # Escape Sequences.
        $'\e')
            read -rsn 2
            printf '%s %q\n' "key:" "${1}${REPLY}"
        ;;

        # Return / Enter.
        "")
            printf '%s\n' "key: \" \""
        ;;

        # Everything else.
        *)
            printf '%s %q\n' "key:" "$1"
        ;;
    esac
}

read -srn 1 && key "$REPLY"
```
